The directory "stoch_sim_setup" contains all files needed to reproduce simulations from Stanford et al. (2023) using the Weather 
Research and Forecasting (WRF; doi:10.5065/D6MK6B4K) model. Please first refer to the file "stanford_et_al_2023_stoch_sims_instructions.docx"
which will provide instructions for employing the other files in the folder.

The directory "data_processing_and_figure_code" contains Python scripts used to process all simulation data and produce the figures
used in the manuscript.
